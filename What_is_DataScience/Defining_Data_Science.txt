- Data Science is a process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.


Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.

You have a model or hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data.

 Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data. It's when you translate data into a story. 

 Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form. Data science is the study of data. 


Fundamentals of Data Science


- has a significant data analysis component. 
- understand environments, 

- Ask questions, clarify, what data to be used structure or unstructured, 


"Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.

New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 20th century, paying high salaries for skilled workers."

What do data scientists do?


Cloud is a godsend for data scientists primarily because you take your data, take your information, and put it in the Cloud, put it in the central storage system


The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.

Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 

Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.
